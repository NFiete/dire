# DIRE: Dictionary Integrated Reading Environment

(include a image here.)
(also a gif with a video or something)

Dire is a dictionary program meant for language learners. When reading in a
foreign language learners will have to look up thousands of words. Therefore
Dire tries to make it as easy as possible to look up a word. Dire is able to
handle word conjugations languges without spaces (like Japanese), and works with
the dictionaries you use.

Also because Dire just handles text it works well for recursive lookups.

Dire is also extensible allowing for easy integration with other applications.

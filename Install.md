The way I install it is I just create a symlink in my path. If you do not want
to do this you can move all the files into your python path then create a helper
script to launch the main functions. I am working on a setup.py.

Additionally you will need to create a config in /usr/share/dire. You can copy
default\_config.py to /usr/share/dire/config.py

Then you need to add dictionaries as described in dicts.md
